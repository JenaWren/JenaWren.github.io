	<h2>About the movie</h2>
		<p>A Walk in the Woods is based on the true story of travel writer Bill Bryson. Bryson has retired in New Hampshire, but instead of relaxing, decides he is going to hike over two thousand miles along the Appalachian Trail. Hilarity ensues when his very old, very out-of-shape friend Katz is the only one willing to join him.</p>
	<h2>Cast</h2>
		<p>- Robert Redford as Bill Bryson</p>
		<p>- Nick Nolte as Katz</p>
		<p>- Emma Thompson as Catherine Bryson</p>
	<h2>Funniest line from the movie:</h2>
		<p>"How do you know all this stuff?" "Well, there are these things called books." "Oh, no kidding, they're called books?" "Yeah, they're like TV for smart people." </p>
